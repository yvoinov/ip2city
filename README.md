Oracle ApEx IP2CITY application is PoC (proof-of-concept) implementation based on MaxMind database with fully in-database implementation.

Works fast even considering the fact that all data, including blobs, is stored in a database.

The data is loaded by the SQL\*loader, the loading scripts are located in the \_dev directory.
